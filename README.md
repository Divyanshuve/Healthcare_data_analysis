I,m sharing  my latest Data Analyst project on Heritage Hospital's(Hypothetical Name) sales dashboard for 2024.

Using DAX, Power BI, Excel , I created this comprehensive dashboard to provide valuable insights into hospital operations. Here are some key objectives and solutions derived from the data and a glimpse into the process and the outcomes:
Process:
1. Data Collection: Gathered sales data from various sources and consolidated it into Excel.
2. Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy and consistency by cleaning and transforming the data in Excel.
3. Data Modeling: Used DAX to create calculated columns and measures for deeper analysis.
4. Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

Objectives and Solutions:-

1. Objective: Improve Bed Occupancy Rates
Solution: Analyze the bed occupancy data to identify trends and patterns. Implement strategies to optimize bed usage, such as better scheduling and patient flow management. The dashboard shows that private beds have the highest occupancy, indicating a potential area for optimization in general and ICU beds.

2. Objective: Enhance Patient Feedback and Satisfaction
Solution: Utilize the feedback volume of doctors to identify areas for improvement in patient care. The dashboard shows feedback percentages for different doctors, which can be used to recognize high-performing doctors and provide additional training or support where needed.

3. Objective: Reduce Billing Amount Discrepancies
Solution: Compare billing amounts with insurance amounts to identify discrepancies and areas for cost reduction. The dashboard's billing amount versus insurance amount graph helps in visualizing these discrepancies across different diagnosis types, allowing for targeted financial strategies.

Useful Insights:

1. Bed Occupancy: Private beds have the highest occupancy, followed by general and ICU beds. This indicates a potential need to optimize the usage of general and ICU beds.

2. Feedback Volume: The feedback volume is evenly distributed among the doctors, with each doctor receiving around 14.28% to 14.29% of the feedback. This suggests a balanced patient-doctor interaction.

3. Diagnosis Types: Viral infections are the most common diagnosis, followed by flu and malaria. Fractures are the least common. This information can help in resource allocation and preparedness for common ailments.

4. Billing Amount vs. Insurance Amount: The graph shows a close alignment between the sum of billing amounts and the sum of health insurance amounts across different diagnosis types, indicating efficient billing practices
